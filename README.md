# MieTheory
Matlab code to compute the optical properties of spherical nanoparticles using Mie theory.

When coding Mie theory, one usually needs to spend some time and read a couple of papers or books, fighting
with the cgs and SI units, before clearly understanding what the parameters mean and before making sure that
one writes a proper code. This Matlab code is meant to help you save some time.
This algorithm in described in J. Phys. Chem. C 119, 28586â€“28596 (2015).
